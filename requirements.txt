# Installed pyreft without flash-attn - Used --no-deps to skip flash-attn which has build issues on macOS ARM
# later install pyvenen with --no-deps to skip pyreft which is already installed

# pyreft>=0.1.0
# pyvenen>=0.1.7

# WHY?
# Requires building from source on macOS ARM64
# Needs torch already installed during its build process
# Is primarily an optimization library (not required for core functionality)
